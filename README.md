# Teeny Tiny Basic
A (poorly executed) C implementation of the Tiny BASIC compiler found in [this article](http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~azh/blog/teenytinycompiler1.html) by Dr. Austin Henley
and in [this github repo](https://github.com/AZHenley/teenytinycompiler). I did pretty well in Automata last semester and was excited to take Compiler Design this Fall, but my
school isn't offering it so I'm putting on my big boy pants and teaching myself how to write a compiler (with no memory leaks to boot!).
